### Measuring product value

Hard to measure how the users perceived that value of your application, this is often "Fuzy". We need to make this more measureable by making some assumptions.

- eg. How much fun and entertainment users are getting from a video streaming service

  - how much videos does a user watch a day/week/month
  - how long does the user wactch videos

In some cases, the assumptions are too risky and qualitative feedback will be needed on top of the quantitative feedback gathered by Analytics tools. When combine both of these researches we can jump to conclusions.

- eg. Anxiety reduction in users of a meditation

  - questions

    - (quantitative) completion rate of meditation sessions
    - (quantitative) weekly retention of users
    - (qualitative) What is your perceived anxiety

  - Conclusions
    - How does using the app on a weekly basic impact the user's anxiety.
    - How does completing x percentage of sessions impact the user's anxiety
      ...

- eg. Rodi

  - questions

    - (quantitative) How many rides are completed on Rodi per week
    - (qualitative) How many rides does the user do in totals (with and without Rodi)

  - Conclusions
    - How much does the user depend on Rodi for his bike rides.

## What is a value moment

Your product’s value moment is an event, an action, or a series of events and actions that represent the moment that a user found value in your product

Tinder -> like on a photo
MyFitnessPall -> completion of a workout
Twitch -> watch +5 minutes of a stream
DocuSign -> Sign a contract
Rodi -> Start a ride

_setup moments_

Moments that a user needs to perform before they can come to the value moment

Setup moments should be kept as low as possible as user's might dropof before experiencing the value moment.

examples

- creating an account
- adding a credit card
- extensive onboarding
- notification permissions
- adding friends

## Which metrics should i pick to measure product success.

[TODO] mixpanel course on defining north start metrics -> https://mixpanel.com/content/guide-to-product-metrics/full-report/

Value moments are building blocks to good product adoption. The more value moments, the more oportunities to build a habit for the user.

_North Star metric or Focus metric_

Turning value into a single key metric

- Tinder -> get a match
- Therapy app -> # of user who complete a - session weekly
- MyFitnessPall -> # of user who complete a workout weekly
- DocuSign -> # of contracts signs monthly
- DocuSign -> Time between sharing and signing
- Rodi -> # of rides over 1km completed - weekly

## Where do product leaders typically go wrong when defining their value metric?

north start metric shoulc

- is responsive to product changes
- is an aggregate measure of the product’s value for its users
- can be readily tied to value for the business or to broader company goals
- is expected to remain relevant for a reasonable duration of time

A north start metric should be accompanied with a set of metrics that might impact the north start metric and help understand any changes in this north start metric.
